# Project-FF-E

Hello! 

Welcome to Project FF&E by Shreyas Basavanahalli Chandrappa.

This is a sample Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment's (FF&E) database management system I created from ground up for a private infrastructure service provider catering to small house owners to demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and implement a comprehensive functional database solution using Microsoft Access.

You can download the Project_FF&E_VM.accdb file with GitHub's download raw file option. I have shared the login password in my cover letter.

If you come across any problems while downloading or have any questions, please feel free to contact me at shreyasbc95@gmail.com.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Shreyas
